# Lecture 1: Introduction

- **Date:** September 7, 2023
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

Welcome to my course on Machine Intelligence in Python. In this course we will learn about the basics of AI and Machine Learning. We will use Python and its libraries for implementations. These notes derive from slides for [CSCI 485 VIU Fall 2023](http://csci.viu.ca/~liuh/485)

## What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a computer program to think and learn. It is also a field of study which tries to make computers *smart*. They work on their own without being hard coded with commands.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a topic of AI. It is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. It is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a topic of Machine Learning. It is inspired by the structure and function of the brain. It is a program that learns to recognise patterns in digital representations of sounds, images and other data.

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level (abstracted from lower-level operations), interpreted, and object-oriented scripting language. It is designed to be highly readable. Where other languages use punctuation, like brackets and colons, Python has fewer syntactical constructions. 

Instead it relies on simple keywords and indentation.

As a result it is easier to learn and read.

## Why Python for this class?

- Simple syntax and readibility allow students to focus on learning AI concepts. 

- Open source and has a large community. 

- Rich set of libraries and tools for AI. 

- Portable and can be used on any platform. 

- Large collection of libraries for scientific computing, data analysis/visualization, and machine learning.
